### Why mindset matters more than speed

- **Sustainable pace:** Burnout is the enemy of good work. Fast is fragile. Slow is sustainable.
- **Creative energy:** Progress feels better when you're not chasing ghosts or imaginary competition.
- **Presence:** Most of your time as a founder will be in the _building_ phase. If you can't enjoy _this part_, you'll never be satisfied with the next one either.

### How to enjoy your founder journey more

- Work on problems that matter **to you**, not just to the market.
- Share progress publicly — not for validation, but for connection.
- Take moments to reflect on how far you’ve come, even if the goal is still far away.

### A few small rituals:

- Start each day with one question: _“What would make today feel meaningful?”_
- Write a short weekly reflection, even if it's messy.
- Disconnect often. Solitude feeds clarity.

Founding is not just about exit multiples or pitch decks.  
It’s about building something real — _and becoming someone real in the process_.

Let yourself enjoy the flavor of slow progress. It’s the only kind that sticks.
